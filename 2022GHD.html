<h2>Coding 코딩</h2>
<h5>This is a start of my <strong><u><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">coding </a></u> study</strong>.</h5>
From. 2022-01-09. First English diary Webpage.
<p>I have 8 days to back to my real home where my parents live. <br>
Recently I lost my job. It was really tough because of my boss.</p>
<img src="tired.jpg" width="100%">
<p style="margin-top:40px;"> He was so errogant person.
He often request me something that I never experienced or been taught.
If I ask how can I do that work. He always add unpleasant words.
Like "what you've done without learning these simple things.", "Don't ask me and do it yourself by looking up past works."
These insult pissed me off.
Add to this, he often rescheduled my work times as his likes.
I worked only 4 days on December 2021.
Even when he fired me, he noted it me as his likes.
It was thankful that I don't have to work no more with him. But it also made me mad.</p>
